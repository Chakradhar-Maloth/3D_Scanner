# 3D_Scanner

## Project Overview
This project provides a step-by-step guide to building an affordable and accessible 3D scanner using off-the-shelf components and open-source software. The scanner uses an Arduino Uno R3 to control NEMA17 stepper motors for object rotation and sensor elevation, a VL53L0X laser range finder for distance measurements, and a Micro SD card module to store scan data. The goal is to democratize 3D scanning technology for creators, educators, and hobbyists.
